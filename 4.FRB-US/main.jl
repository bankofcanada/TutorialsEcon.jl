# ##  The Model File

# We recommend placing the model definition in its own Julia module in a separate
# source file. Although this is not strictly necessary, it helps to keep the code
# well organized and it also allows us to take advantage of pre-compilation. The
# first time we load the model file it takes some time to compile, and after that
# loading is much faster.

# The FRB/US model we will be working with is located in models/FRBUS_VAR.jl.
# This file was automatically generated from the `model.xml` file contained
# within frbus_package.zip.

# ### Some Notes About the Julia Model File

# 1. Some variables are declared as *log variables* using the `@log` declaration
#    within a `@variables` block. For example

#    ```julia
#    @variables model begin
#        # ... #
#        "Investment in equipment, current \$" @log ebfin
#        "Personal consumption expenditures, current \$ (NIPA definition)" @log ecnian
#        # ... #
#    end
#    ```

#     A full discussion of log variables is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
#     However a very simplified explanation is that this improves the stability of
#     the numerical solver for variables which are always positive.

# 2. Variables which do not have an associated equation, and for which data is
#    always given, are declared *exogenous* using an `@exogenous` block. For
#    example

#    ```julia
#    @exogenous model begin
#        # Exogenous variables:
#        "Potential government employment ratio (relative to business)" adjlegrt
#        "Dummy, post-1979 indicator" d79a
#        "Dummy, 1980-1995 indicator" d8095
#        # ... #
#    end
#    ```

# 3. The EViews syntax is translated to Julia syntax. EViews functions `d()` and
#    `dlog()` are replaced with their equivalent StateSpaceEcon *meta functions*
#    `@d()` and `@dlog()`. EViews `@movav()` is left alone, because a *meta
#    function* by the same name already exists in StateSpaceEcon, and does the
#    same thing. Finally, the EViews `@recode()` is replaced with the equivalent
#    Julia function `ifelse()`, or where appropriate with a `min()` or a `max()`.

# 4. Several equations contain expressions matching the pattern
#    `1 / (1 + exp(-cx))`, where `c` is a large constant (usually 25) and `x` is
#    some expression. This sigmoid function is a smooth approximation of the
#    Heaviside step function for large values of `c`. While mathematically the
#    derivative of this function is well defined and converges to approximately
#    zero everywhere outside a very small interval containing 0, numerically it
#    causes problems because it results in either 0/0 or ∞/∞. To remedy this
#    situation, we replace such patterns with equivalent calls to `heaviside(cx)`,
#    where the function `heaviside()` is defined in the model file.

#    ```julia
#    export heaviside
#    "Heaviside step function" @inline heaviside(x) = convert(typeof(x), x>zero(x))
#    ```

# ### Regenerating the Model File

# We have included the script update_models.jl. It is not necessary for
# running the code below, but it may be helpful for further experimentation.

# If the model file is missing, for some reason or another, this script will
# automatically download `frbus_package.zip` and process the `model.xml` within it
# to re-generate `model/FRBUS_VAR.jl`. This could also be useful if you make
# modifications to `model.xml` (including not only the equations, but also the
# parameter values), or if you want to use a different FRBUS package from the one
# posted on the FRBUS website. In this case, simply place your `frbus_package.zip`
# in the `models/` directory and run `update_models.jl`. Of course such
# modifications can also be done directly into the existing `models/FRBUS_VAR.jl`
# file.

# Note that after updating `models/FRBUS_VAR.jl`, it'd be best to restart the
# REPL. The first time you load the new model module it'll take a bit longer due
# to pre-compilation.

# Update models files if necessary
models_path = joinpath(mypath, "models")

# ## Load the Model

# Assuming that the `models/` directory is already in the `LOAD_PATH` list, we can
# load the model by `using` its module. Once loaded, the module contains a
# variable `model` which represents the model object.

unique!(push!(LOAD_PATH, models_path))
using FRBUS_VAR
m = FRBUS_VAR.model

## ###########
# We see that the model has a number of variables, shocks, equations, and
# parameters. The total number of variables include exogenous variables.

m.variables

## #######
# We also see that the model object includes a number of auxiliary equations.
# These equations (and variables) are automatically added as substitutions for
# expressions that must be positive.

m.auxeqns

## #######
# For example, we see that variable `aux1` was added with the first equation in
# the above list. At the same time, in equation for `dpgap`, the expression
# `log(phr[t] * pxp[t])` has been replaced by `aux1[t]`.

get(m.equations, 2)

# A detailed discussion of auxiliary variables and equations is beyond the scope
# of this tutorial. It suffices to say that we can safely ignore their presence
# for now.


## ##########################################################################
# ## Load the Longbase Data

# Unfortunately the `longbase` data is loaded from the LONGBASE.TXT file provided in the FRB/US data package.
# The file is read and parsed via the function defined in load_longbase.jl. Note that this is not a module, 
# so we load it by calling `include()`, not `using`. We have saved a copy of this file as of 2022-11-29, named
# `longbase_2022-11-29.csv`

include("load_longbase.jl")
longbase = load_longbase("longbase_2022-11-29.csv")

## ##########################################################################
# ## Load `set_policy.jl`

# The model contains a number of switch variables to control which monetary policy
# function is used and which fiscal policy function is used at each period of the
# simulation. For convenience, we have included functions `set_mp!()` and
# `set_fp!()`, which are defined in set_policy.jl.

# load functions set_mp! and set_fp!
include("set_policy.jl")

# check out the docs. In the REPL you can also type ?set_mp!
@doc set_mp!

# these are the mp switches
dmp_switches

#  these are their descriptions
for s in dmp_switches
    v = filter(x -> x.name == s, m.variables)[1]
    println("$s : \t$(v.doc)")
end

# and the docs for setting fiscal policy
@doc set_fp!

# these are the fp switches
dfp_switches

# these are their descriptions
for s in dfp_switches
    v = filter(x -> x.name == s, m.variables)[1]
    println("$s : \t$(v.doc)")
end


## ##########################################################################
# ## Prepare the Simulation Plan

# The simulation is controlled by a `Plan` object. The plan is defined by
# a model object and a simulation range. The full range handled by the plan
# contains additional periods before and after the simulation range, which account
# for initial and final conditions. By default, the simulation plan is setup such
# that all shocks are exogenous and all variables are endogenous, except for the
# variables that are declared either in an `@exogenous` block or with the `@exog`
# declaration within an `@variables` block in the model file.

sim = 2022Q1:2027Q4     # simulation range
p = Plan(m, sim)        # the plan object

ini = firstdate(p):first(sim)-1      # range of initial conditions
fin = last(sim)+1:lastdate(p)        # range of final conditions

# Note that the `fin` range is actually empty. 
# This is because this model doesn't have any leads.
isempty(fin)

## ##########################################################################
# ## Prepare the Exogenous Data

# We start by pre-allocating simulation data that is set to 0 everywhere.  Then we
# assign within it the data from `longbase` using Julia's `.=` operator.

# ed = exogenous data
ed = zerodata(m, p);
ed .= longbase[p.range];

# Next we set the monetary policy, the fiscal policy and a few other switches.

# set monetary policy (Inertial Taylor Rule)
set_mp!(ed, :dmpintay);

# turn off zero bound and policy thresholds;
# hold policy maker's perceived equilibrium real interest rate
ed.dmptrsh .= 0.0;
ed.rffmin .= -9999;
ed.drstar .= 0.0;

# set fiscal policy (Surplus Ratio Stabilization)
set_fp!(ed, :dfpsrp);

## ##########################################################################
# ## Back out the Shocks

# The first simulation test is to compute the shocks given the variable paths from
# `longbase`. To do this, we swap the variables and shocks, making variables
# exogenous and shocks endogenous. The mapping between variables and their
# corresponding shocks is declared in the model file, so we can simply call
# `autoexogenize!`. We make a copy of the plan `p`, so that the original
# plan would not be modified. We also make a copy of the exogenous data, `ed`, so
# that the original would remain unchanged.

p_0 = autoexogenize!(copy(p), m, sim)
ed_0 = copy(ed)

# Now we run the `simulate` command. Note that the first time we run a
# function in Julia it takes a bit longer due to compilation time. In this case,
# it takes much longer because the model is very large and each and every equation
# gets compiled together with its automatic derivative.

sol_0 = @time simulate(m, p_0, ed_0; verbose = true, tol = 1e-12);

# The compilation is done once and the compiled code is used in every call after
# that. So the second call to `simulate` is much, much faster.

sol_0 = @time simulate(m, p_0, ed_0; verbose = true, tol = 1e-12);

## ##########################################################################
# ## Recover the Baseline Case

# Next simulation is a sanity check test. If we run a simulation with the shocks
# set to the values we just backed out, the resulting variable paths must match
# the ones we started with.

# Once again we start with an exogenous data set everywhere to 0. Then we assign
# only the initial conditions and the shocks we just backed out.

p_r = Plan(m, sim);
ed_r = zerodata(m, p_r);

# initial conditions for the variables are taken from longbase
ed_r[ini, m.variables] .= longbase[ini, m.variables];

# shocks are taken from from sol_0
ed_r[p_r.range, m.shocks] .= sol_0[p_r.range, m.shocks];

# exogenous variables are also taken  from sol_0
exogenous = [v for v in m.variables if isexog(v)];
ed_r[p_r.range, exogenous] .= sol_0[p_r.range, exogenous];

# Now, the only thing left is to set the initial guess for the endogenous
# variables. If we leave it at 0, that would be an initial guess too far from the
# solution and the Newton-Raphson will likely diverge. If we set it to the known
# solution, that would diminish this exercise to merely verifying that it is
# indeed a solution (we already know that). So, to make things a bit more
# interesting, we add a bit of noise to the true solution.

endogenous = [v for v in m.variables if !isexog(v)];
ed_r[sim, endogenous] .= longbase[sim, endogenous] .+ 0.03 .* randn(length(sim), length(endogenous));

# Once again we have to set the monetary policy and the fiscal policy rules, as
# well as the values of some of the other switches.

set_mp!(ed_r, :dmpintay);
ed_r.dmptrsh .= 0.0;
ed_r.rffmin .= -9999;
ed_r.drstar .= 0.0;
set_fp!(ed_r, :dfpsrp);

# And finally we can run the simulation and check to make sure that indeed the
# recovered simulation matches the base case.

sol_r = @time simulate(m, p_r, ed_r; verbose = true, tol = 1e-9);
@test sol_r ≈ sol_0

## ##########################################################################
# ## Simulate a shock

# The last exercise is to simulate the impulse response to a unit shock in
# `rffintay`.
m.rffintay

# We start with the base case and add 1 to the `rffintay_a` shock at the first
# period of the simulation.

p_1 = Plan(m, sim);
ed_1 = copy(sol_0);

ed_1.rffintay_a[first(sim)] += 1;
sol_1 = @time simulate(m, p_1, ed_1; verbose = true, tol = 1e-9);

# Finally, we can plot the impulse response function to see what we've done.
# compute the differences between the base case and the shocked simulation.
